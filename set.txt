SETS:
    -- Unorderd, unindexed
    -- Mutable
    -- No Duplicate Item
    -- it contain immutable items only, means we can contain int,float,string and even tuple inside set but 
       we can't contain list inside set and no any Mutable item inside set
    -- Represented by {}, but assigning empty {} is not set it becomes dictionay, empty set can be created by set()
        => a = {}                : it is dictionay
        => a = {a, b, n, r, y}   : it is set
        => a = {a:b, c:d}        : it is dictionay
        => a = set()             : it is set
        => a = dict()            : it is dictionay

Creation:
    1. x = {value1, value2, value3, ...........}
    2. x = set(iterable)

    set()
        - create set
        - it takes iterable as argument i.e. x = set([3,5,7,4]) : list is iterable
          output: x = {3,5,7,4}


Deletion:
    1. discard (value) -- takes one argument, value to be deleted, and it will throw error if value to be deleted is not present in set
    2. remove(value)  -- takes one argument that is value to be deleted, and it will throw error if value to be deleted is not present in set
    3. pop()          -- dont takes any argument, it will pop any random value and it returns the deleted value
    4. clear()        -- makes set empty, no matter how many value set contain it will be empty

Addition:
    1. add(value) -- takes one value as argument, adds in any arbitary position because set is Unorderd
    2. update([value, value, value,.......]) -- for adding multiple values, takes iterables

Some important functions for SET:
    - len(), min(), max(), sum(), any(), all(), sorted()
     : any() -- returns true if any of the value is true(i.e. not 0 )
        {2,3,5,0} -> true
        {0,0} --> false
        {5,7,8} -> true
     : all() -- returns true if all the value is true 
        {2,3,5,0} -> false
        {0,0} --> false
        {5,7,8} -> true

SET Methods:
    - union()    -- Returns union of two sets in ascending order
    - intersection() -- Returns intersection of two sets
    - difference()  -- Returns values present in set_one but not in set_two  (example: set_one.difference(set_two) )
                    => this will only show values it will not change set itself, if you want to change set then use difference_update
    - symmetric_difference() -- Returns values which are not present in any of two sets but not in  both set
    - intersection_update() -- update the set with calculated value of intersection
    - difference_update() -- update the set with calculated difference (set2.difference_update(set1) then set2 will be updated with difference value)
    - copy() -- copies the set
    - isdisjoint() -- Returns true if there is no any common value in both the sets (true if intersection is empty)
    - issubset() -- Returns true if subset of set
    - issuperset() -- Returns true in case of superset
